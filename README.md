# Vudeljump

Vudeljump is a Rust project that uses Vulkan as a graphics API â€“ **without** any additional graphics library. It is a pure Vulkan project that communicates directly with the GPU.

## Requirements
- **Rust** (Install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- A GPU that supports **Vulkan**

## Installation & Build
Run the following command to compile and start the project:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

This compiles the project with optimizations and runs it.

## How to Play
- Use A and D to move the Player
- Use the platforms to get as high as possible
- Use the button that has no text to respawn

## Features
- Written in **Rust**
- Direct use of **Vulkan**, no graphics libraries
- High-performance rendering
- Gets harder the higher you get (Still remains easy because there are no opponents)

Have fun with **Vudeljump**! ðŸš€
